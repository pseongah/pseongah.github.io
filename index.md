## About Me

I am a graduate in Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering at Sookmyung Women's University. I had the opportunity to conduct research at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). Under the guidance of _Dr. Kahye Song_, I worked on the development of a Pop-up space intelligence platform for human-robot interaction. After graduation, I continued my research under [_Dr. Yoonseob Lim_](https://sites.google.com/view/hbum/home?authuser=0), focusing on the development of service robots.

My research goal is to advance robots to perform more complex tasks and make intelligent decisions in various environments. My areas of interest are using reinforcement learning to identify the best robot behavior and creating a cooperative service robot system that considers user requirements.
